# MiniRT <img style="float: right;" src="img/grade.png" alt="grade" width="80"/>

![Phong demo](img/phong_demo.png)
The MiniRT project is a minimalist ray-tracing engine built using fixed-point arithmetic in C. This compact yet powerful engine renders 3D scenes with realistic lighting and shadows, while leveraging the precision and performance benefits of fixed-point number representation. Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, MiniRT demonstrates the potential of ray-tracing techniques in resource-constrained environments, using the new updated Codam's version of the MLX42[^1].
## This is a RayTracer in C
Made for UNIX systems, Linux and MacOs
- With implementation of fixed point numbers
- With Phong reflexion
- Light colors
![color demo](img/color_demo.png)
- Paper style shapes with light passing through one side.
    - Spheres
    - Cylinders
    - Planes
## Compile
`$>make` in main repo
 - It will build the Codam's MLX42[^1] in the include repo depending on OS and detect if GLFW[^2] is installed. 
## Run
ex: `./miniRT scene/columns.rt`
