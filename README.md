# MiniRT
The MiniRT project is a minimalist ray-tracing engine built using fixed-point arithmetic in C. This compact yet powerful engine renders 3D scenes with realistic lighting and shadows, while leveraging the precision and performance benefits of fixed-point number representation. Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, MiniRT demonstrates the potential of ray-tracing techniques in resource-constrained environments, using the new updated Codam's version of the MLX42.
